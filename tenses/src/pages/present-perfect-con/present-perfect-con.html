  <p>
    •	The present perfect continuous is used to refer to an unspecified time between 'before now' and 'now'. <br /> <br />
    •	The speaker is thinking about something that started but perhaps did not finish in that period of time. <br /> <br />
    •	He/she is interested in the process as well as the result, and this process may still be going on, or may have just finished.<br /> <br />
